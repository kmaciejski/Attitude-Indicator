# Summary
The main purpose of this work was to design and build an electronic artificial horizon. The theoretical part of the work contains a short description and technical specification of two different EFSI instruments.
After analyzing the constructions existing on the market, the electronic components included in the designed device were selected.
The ESP32 microcontroller with cooperating elements has been described.
After completing the theoretical part of the work, a step-by-step procedure for designing the electrical, mechanical and software parts of the device was presented.
Finally, the device was completed and tested. 
The project includes: determining hardware requirements, selecting electronic components, drawing up an electrical diagram, designing a PCB, writing software, modeling a housing adapted to the PCB, assembling and testing the device.
